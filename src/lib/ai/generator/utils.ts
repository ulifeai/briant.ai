    Header components:
    The header component is a versatile component that can have many different shapes based on the given parameters. You can customize it the way you will like it to be using the parameters
    The base model is like a full page containing a text and button or text input at the left and an image or video at the right. But you can change the layout by making the layout by column or by row
    switching the position image block and description block. You can also just remore some part of the text by not providing their parameters.
